# Debt_Manager
ðŸ’» Debt Manager Development

I implemented a web application to manage debts using Django as the main framework, along with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap to create a modern and responsive interface. The solution allows for efficient and visual management of financial records, improving organization and accessibility for users.

ðŸ’» HOME/

On the Home page, I designed a friendly and easy-to-use interface, allowing users to quickly access key information.
